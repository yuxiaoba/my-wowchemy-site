abstract: Recently, the adoption of Software Defined Networking (SDN) as a network infrastructure for efficiently managing underlying network 
has gained significant popularity. Although the openness and programmability of SDN ease the construction of large complex networks, it is still challenging to diagnose faults in a complex datacenter-scale network, which is crucial to guarantee rigorous service level agreement (SLA) of upper-layer applications. Previous network diagnosis tools incur significant overhead in fine-grained telemetry, and usually lack the ability to automatically diagnose fine-grained faults. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we present MARS, a lightweight system for anomaly detection with dynamic threshold and automatic root cause localization in programmable networking systems.
