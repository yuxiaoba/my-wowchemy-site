# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper proposes a novel system, named GIED, which is a method to automatically analyze the cascading effect of availability issues in online systems. GIED enables the extraction of graph-based issue representations. This representation includes both the issue symptoms and affected service attributes. A neural network is used to perform incident detection. Finally, the PageRank algorithm is used to locate the root cause of the incident.
