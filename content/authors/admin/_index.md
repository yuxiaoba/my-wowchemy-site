I am Guangba Yu (余广坝 in Chinese). I am a 3nd year Ph.D. candidate at Sun Yat-Sen University, advised by Professor [Pengfei Chen](http://www.dds-sysu.tech/Teachers). I am interested in cloud native, microservice, Serverless, and AIOps. My research focus on managing large-scale cloud-native systems in heterogeneous computing continuum, improving their reliability, performance and  resource efficiency. 
And I have a strong curiosity about telemetry of cloud-native systems.

I have awarded Tencent Rhino-Bird Research Elite Program and Tencent Special Scholarship in 2022. I am a Ph.D. software engineering student researcher at WeChat in 2022, hosted by [Yuetang Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=jiPCz_cAAAAJ).
