I am Guangba Yu (余广坝 in Chinese). I will be a postdoctoral researcher in the [Automated Reliable Intelligent Software Engineering (ARISE) Lab](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, mentored by Prof. [Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/).

I received Ph.D. and M.Eng at Sun Yat-Sen University, advised by Professor [Pengfei Chen](http://www.dds-sysu.tech/Teachers). I am interested in cloud native, microservice, AIOps and MLOps. My research focus on perfromance diagnose and optimization in distributed systems. And I have a strong curiosity about telemetry of cloud systems.

I have awarded Tencent Rhino-Bird Research Elite Program and Tencent Special Scholarship in 2022. I am a Ph.D. software engineering student researcher at WeChat in 2022, hosted by [Yuetang Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=jiPCz_cAAAAJ). 


I maintain a Github project about [Awesome cloud paper](https://github.com/IntelligentDDS/awesome-papers) and a WeChat public account [WeeklyCloudPaper](https://yuxiaoba.github.io/authors/admin/weeklycloudpaper.jpg) in Chinese. Welcome to follow my updates.
